  CSS which belonged on here, is to be tranfered to the stylesheet. Let's make this guy bare.">

      Back in early-autumn 2019, I experimented with <i>8-bit</i> pixel art.
      I spent a few weeks drawing this way, but I found using GIMP was too
      time-dense. As much as I enjoyed the medium, I cannot bring myself to resume.

      As to why I chose to change my logo? It kist felt like time. I stumbled upon
      <i> CSS art </i> on a social software development website. In all likelihood,
      I must have seen some in the past. Regardless, my new edition of my logo was
      drawn using pure CSS (and some HTML, of course, the divs), it was my actual
      first attempt drawing anything original. I'm mighty proud of my results.

      <h2> The Pro's </h2>
      <p>

      The following, imho, is the benefits of the updated version of my logo:
      <ul>
        <li><b> more modern feel </b></li>
        <li> made 100% with <a href="https://codepen.io/resabalsdon/pen/zYwvbNJ"> code </a> </li>
        <li><i> looks better on a larger surface  </i></li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Note</h3>
        I know the jibber-jabber formatting everywhere looks dumb.
        I chose to leave in some of the examples, because this was 'homework'
        from a quick course I took.
