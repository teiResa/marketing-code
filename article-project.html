I would prefer this over Jekyll for now. The articles could easily share a single style sheet like "articles.css"

CSS which belonged on here, is to be tranfered to the style sheet. Let's make this guy bare.">

<h1> Replacing My Personal Logo </h1>

Back in early-autumn 2019, I experimented with <i>8-bit</i> pixel art.
I spent a few weeks drawing this way, but I found using GIMP was too
time-dense. As much as I enjoyed the medium, I cannot bring myself to resume.

As to why I chose to change my logo? It kist felt like time. I stumbled upon
<i> CSS art </i> on a social software development website. In all likelihood,
I must have seen some in the past. Regardless, my new edition of my logo was
drawn using pure CSS (and some HTML, of course, the divs), it was my actual
first attempt drawing anything original. I'm mighty proud of my results.
